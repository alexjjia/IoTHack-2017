# NotPokemonGo

Short WIP for Rutgers' IoT / Mobile Hackathon that was hosted in April 2017.


The basic concept is to build an Augmented Reality application (preferably for Android devices, as I currently do not own a Mac) that is to be incorporated with the Google Cardboard. APIs used included Vuforia, Unity, and Keijiro's Skinner Package.

All in all, it was mainly a proof-of-concept sort of hack, just to see if I could do something like this. I'm pretty happy with what I have for now, as it means that I can progress even further with the technologies at hand.
